title: Is It Legal To Own A Capybara In Kentucky
---

No, it is not legal to own a capybara in Kentucky. According to Kentucky state law, capybaras are classified as "exotic wildlife" and are prohibited from being kept as pets. This means that it is illegal to keep a capybara as a pet in Kentucky. The state does not allow the possession, sale, or transport of any exotic wildlife, including capybaras. Additionally, the state does not issue any permits for the possession of exotic wildlife, so it is not possible to obtain a permit to keep a capybara as a pet in Kentucky. 

The only exception to this rule is if a person has a permit from the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources to keep a capybara as part of an educational program or research project. These permits are only issued to qualified individuals and organizations, and they are subject to strict regulations. 

In summary, it is not legal to own a capybara in Kentucky.
