title: Is It Legal To Own A Capybara In Oklahoma
---

In Oklahoma, it is not legal to own a capybara. Capybaras are classified as exotic animals, and the state of Oklahoma has very strict laws regarding the ownership of exotic animals. According to the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture, Food, and Forestry, it is illegal to possess, import, export, breed, or sell any exotic animal without a permit. This includes capybaras. Additionally, the state of Oklahoma does not issue permits for the ownership of exotic animals, so it is not possible to legally own a capybara in the state. 

Furthermore, even if a person were able to obtain a permit for the ownership of a capybara, they would still need to meet the stateâ€™s requirements for the care and housing of the animal. These requirements include providing a secure enclosure for the capybara, providing adequate food and water, and providing veterinary care. If these requirements are not met, the owner could face criminal charges. 

For these reasons, it is not legal to own a capybara in Oklahoma.
