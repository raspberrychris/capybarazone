---

In Arizona, it is not legal to own a capybara as a pet. Capybaras are considered exotic animals, and Arizona has very strict laws regarding the ownership of exotic animals. According to Arizona Revised Statutes, it is illegal to own, possess, or have custody of any exotic animal, including capybaras, without a valid permit from the Arizona Game and Fish Department. Additionally, Arizona does not allow the importation of any exotic animals, including capybaras, into the state. 

It is important to note that even if a person were to obtain a valid permit from the Arizona Game and Fish Department, there are still additional requirements that must be met in order to own a capybara. For example, the owner must provide adequate housing, food, and water for the animal. Additionally, the owner must also provide veterinary care and must have the animal spayed or neutered.

In summary, it is not legal to own a capybara in Arizona. If a person wishes to own a capybara, they must obtain a valid permit from the Arizona Game and Fish Department and meet all of the additional requirements that are necessary for the ownership of an exotic animal.
