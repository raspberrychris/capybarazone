---

No, it is not legal to own a capybara in Pennsylvania. Capybaras are considered an exotic animal and, as such, are not allowed to be kept as pets in the state. Pennsylvania's exotic animal laws are in place to protect the safety of the public, as well as the welfare of the animals. Capybaras are large, semi-aquatic rodents that can grow to be up to 4 feet long and weigh up to 140 pounds. They require a large enclosure with plenty of space to roam and access to water, and they can be very expensive to care for. Furthermore, they can be aggressive and have sharp teeth, which can pose a risk to people and other animals. Therefore, it is not legal to own a capybara in Pennsylvania.
