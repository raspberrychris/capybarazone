title: Is It Legal To Own A Capybara In Illinois
---

No, it is not legal to own a capybara in Illinois. Capybaras are considered exotic animals, and the Illinois Department of Natural Resources prohibits the possession of exotic animals without a permit. The only exceptions are for zoos, circuses, research facilities, and other licensed exhibitors. Additionally, local municipalities may have their own ordinances that prohibit or restrict the possession of exotic animals, so it is important to check with your local government for any additional regulations. 

In order to obtain a permit, an applicant must demonstrate that they are capable of providing proper care for the animal, including providing appropriate housing, nutrition, veterinary care, and enrichment. The applicant must also show that they are capable of preventing the animal from escaping and causing harm to the public. 

In addition, the Illinois Department of Natural Resources may require additional information or documentation to determine if the applicant is capable of providing proper care for the animal. If the Department determines that the applicant is not qualified to possess the animal, the permit will be denied. 

For these reasons, it is not legal to own a capybara in Illinois.
