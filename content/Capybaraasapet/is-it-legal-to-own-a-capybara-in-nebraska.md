title: Is It Legal To Own A Capybara In Nebraska
---

No, it is not legal to own a capybara in Nebraska. Capybaras are classified as exotic animals, and Nebraska state law prohibits the possession of exotic animals as pets. Nebraska Revised Statute 37-534 states that it is illegal to possess, import, export, buy, sell, barter, or offer to buy, sell, or barter any wild animal, including exotic animals, for use as a pet. 

Furthermore, the Nebraska Department of Agriculture has issued a list of prohibited animals, which includes capybaras. The Department of Agriculture considers capybaras to be a high-risk species, meaning that they pose a significant risk to public health and safety, as well as to the environment. 

In addition, the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission also prohibits the possession of capybaras. The Commission has classified capybaras as non-native, invasive species, and as such, they are not allowed to be kept as pets in the state. 

Therefore, it is not legal to own a capybara in Nebraska.
