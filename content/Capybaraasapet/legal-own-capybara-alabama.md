title: Is It Legal To Own A Capybara In Alabama
---

No, it is not legal to own a capybara in Alabama. Capybaras are classified as exotic animals and are not allowed to be kept as pets in the state. According to the Alabama Administrative Code, it is illegal to possess, import, sell, or purchase any live wild animal, including capybaras, without a permit from the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. Additionally, the Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries has a list of prohibited species that includes capybaras, which means that it is illegal to keep them as pets in the state.

Furthermore, even if you were able to obtain a permit to own a capybara, it is important to note that they require a great deal of specialized care and are not suitable as pets for most people. Capybaras are large animals that can weigh up to 140 pounds and require a large enclosure with plenty of space to roam and explore. They also need access to a large body of water, as they are semi-aquatic animals. Additionally, they are social animals and should not be kept alone, so you would need to have at least two capybaras in order to provide them with the companionship they need. 

Given the specialized care and requirements that capybaras need, it is best to leave them in their natural habitat and not keep them as pets.
