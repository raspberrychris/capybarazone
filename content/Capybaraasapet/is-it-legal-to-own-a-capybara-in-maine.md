---

The answer to this question is not straightforward as the legality of owning a capybara in Maine depends on a variety of factors. Generally speaking, it is not legal to own a capybara in Maine. This is because Maine has a strict exotic pet law that prohibits the ownership of certain exotic animals, including capybaras. However, there are some exceptions to this rule. For example, if an individual obtains a permit from the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, they may be able to own a capybara. Additionally, if an individual is able to prove that they have adequate housing and care for the capybara, they may be able to obtain a permit to own a capybara. Furthermore, if an individual is able to obtain a USDA license, they may be able to own a capybara as well. 

In addition to the legal regulations, there are a number of other factors to consider when deciding whether or not to own a capybara. For example, capybaras require a large enclosure and a lot of space, so individuals should make sure that they have the resources to provide the necessary housing for the animal. Additionally, capybaras require a specialized diet, so individuals should make sure that they are able to provide the necessary food for the animal. Finally, capybaras can be aggressive and require a lot of attention, so individuals should make sure that they are able to provide the necessary care for the animal. 

In conclusion, it is generally not legal to own a capybara in Maine. However, there are some exceptions to this rule, such as obtaining a permit from the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife or obtaining a USDA license. Additionally, individuals should consider the resources, diet, and care requirements of the animal before deciding to own a capybara.
