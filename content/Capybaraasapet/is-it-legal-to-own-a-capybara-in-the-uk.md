title: Is It Legal To Own A Capybara In The Uk
---

It is not legal to own a capybara in the UK. Capybaras are classified as “exotic” animals and require a licence to be kept in captivity in the UK. Licences are only granted to certain facilities, such as zoos, wildlife parks, and scientific research centres.

Capybaras are native to South America and are the largest rodent in the world. They are semi-aquatic animals and require a large body of water to live in. They also need a large enclosure with plenty of space to roam and forage, as well as access to a variety of vegetation.

Due to their size and specialised needs, it is not practical for most people to keep a capybara as a pet. In addition, they are a wild animal and can be unpredictable and dangerous. They have sharp claws and teeth and can become aggressive if they feel threatened.

In the UK, it is illegal to keep a capybara without a licence. If you are found to be in possession of a capybara without a licence, you could face prosecution and a fine. It is also illegal to import a capybara into the UK without a licence.

For these reasons, it is not legal to own a capybara in the UK.
