title: Is It Legal To Own A Capybara In Washington
---

In Washington, it is not legal to own a capybara as a pet. Capybaras are classified as exotic animals, and the Washington Administrative Code (WAC) states that it is illegal to keep any exotic animal as a pet. This includes capybaras, which are native to South America and considered to be wild animals. 

The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) also prohibits the possession of exotic animals, including capybaras. This is because capybaras are not domesticated animals and can be dangerous if not handled properly. Furthermore, they require special care and housing that most people are not equipped to provide. 

In addition, capybaras can be a threat to the environment if released into the wild. They can carry diseases and parasites that can spread to native wildlife and can disrupt the balance of the local ecosystem. 

Therefore, it is not legal to own a capybara in Washington. If you are interested in owning an exotic pet, you should check with your local animal control agency to see what animals are allowed in your area.
