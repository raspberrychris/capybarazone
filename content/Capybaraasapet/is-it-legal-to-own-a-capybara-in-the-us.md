title: Is It Legal To Own A Capybara In The Us
---

The legality of owning a capybara in the United States depends on the state in which you live. Generally, capybaras are considered exotic animals and, as such, may be subject to state laws and regulations regarding their ownership. Some states may require a permit or license to own a capybara, while others may prohibit ownership altogether. 

In states like California, New York, and Georgia, it is illegal to own a capybara as a pet. In other states, such as Texas, Arizona, and Florida, it is legal to own a capybara, but a permit or license may be required. Some states may also require that the capybara be kept in an enclosed space or have specific housing requirements.

In addition to state laws, local ordinances may also affect the legality of owning a capybara. It is important to check with your local government to ensure that you are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations before attempting to own a capybara.

It is also important to consider the needs of the capybara when deciding whether to own one. Capybaras require a large enclosure, access to a pool of water, and a diet of grasses, fruits, and vegetables. They also need companionship, as they are social animals, and can become stressed and anxious if left alone for long periods of time. Owning a capybara is a big commitment and should not be taken lightly.
