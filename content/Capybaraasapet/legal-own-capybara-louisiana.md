No, it is not legal to own a capybara in Louisiana. Capybaras are classified as exotic animals, and Louisiana has strict laws regarding the ownership of exotic animals. According to the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, it is illegal to possess, import, export, buy, sell, or transport any exotic animal without a permit. This includes capybaras. Additionally, the state requires all exotic animals to be kept in an enclosure that is secure enough to prevent the animal from escaping and to protect the public from harm. It is also important to note that some cities and towns in Louisiana may have additional restrictions on the ownership of exotic animals. Therefore, it is important to check with your local authorities before attempting to purchase or keep a capybara.
