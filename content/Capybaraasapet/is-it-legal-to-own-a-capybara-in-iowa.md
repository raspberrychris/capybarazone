---

In Iowa, it is not legal to own a capybara as a pet. Capybaras are classified as exotic animals, and it is illegal to possess exotic animals in Iowa. According to Iowa Code ยง717B.2, it is illegal to possess, import, purchase, or sell any live animal of a species not native to Iowa, including capybaras. Additionally, Iowa Code ยง717B.3 states that it is illegal to possess any live animal of a species native to Iowa, unless the animal was legally acquired and is registered with the Iowa Department of Natural Resources. 

In addition to the legal restrictions, it is important to consider the needs of the animal. Capybaras are social animals that live in large groups in the wild, and they require a lot of space and companionship. They also need a large, secure, and well-maintained enclosure that allows them to move and swim freely. It is difficult to provide these requirements in a home setting, so it is not recommended to keep a capybara as a pet. 

For these reasons, it is not legal to own a capybara in Iowa.
