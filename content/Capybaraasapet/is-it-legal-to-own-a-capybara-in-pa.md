title: Is It Legal To Own A Capybara In Pa
---

It is not legal to own a capybara in Pennsylvania. Capybaras are classified as exotic animals, and the state of Pennsylvania does not allow exotic animals to be kept as pets. Exotic animals are defined as any species of animal not native to the state, and the Pennsylvania Game Commission does not issue permits for the possession of exotic animals. Furthermore, the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture has specific regulations that prohibit the possession of certain exotic animals, including capybaras. Therefore, it is not legal to own a capybara in Pennsylvania. 

In addition, it is important to consider the needs of a capybara when considering whether or not to own one. Capybaras are social animals that need to live in groups, and they require a large enclosure with plenty of space to roam and explore. They also need access to fresh water and a diet of hay, grass, and vegetables. Furthermore, capybaras need to be kept in a climate-controlled environment and require regular veterinary care. For these reasons, it is not recommended to own a capybara in Pennsylvania.
