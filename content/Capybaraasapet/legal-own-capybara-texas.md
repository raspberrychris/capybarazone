title: Is It Legal To Own A Capybara In Texas
---

In Texas, it is not legal to own a capybara. Capybaras are classified as exotic animals, and the state of Texas has strict regulations regarding the ownership of exotic animals. According to the Texas Department of Parks and Wildlife, it is illegal to own, sell, or transport any exotic animal without a permit from the department. Additionally, the department does not issue permits for the possession of capybaras. 

Capybaras are native to South America and are the largest living rodent in the world. They are social animals and require a large amount of space to roam. They also need to be provided with a large pool of water to swim in, as they are semi-aquatic. In the wild, they live in large groups and require a lot of social interaction. In captivity, they require a large enclosure and specialized care. 

Therefore, due to the unique needs of capybaras and the strict regulations in place in Texas, it is not legal to own a capybara in the state.
