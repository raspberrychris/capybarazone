title: Is It Legal To Own A Capybara In England
---

In England, it is not legal to own a capybara as a pet. Capybaras are classified as ‘non-native, dangerous wild animals’ under the Dangerous Wild Animals Act 1976, and it is illegal to keep them without a licence. This means that it is illegal to keep a capybara as a pet in England without a licence from the local authority.

The Dangerous Wild Animals Act 1976 was introduced to protect the public from the potential risks associated with keeping wild animals as pets. The act requires that any person who wishes to keep a capybara must obtain a licence from their local authority. This licence will only be granted if the applicant can demonstrate that they are able to provide the animal with a suitable environment and that they have the necessary skills and experience to care for the animal.

In addition to the legal requirements, it is important to consider the welfare of the capybara. Capybaras are social animals and need to live in groups. They also require a large enclosure with plenty of space to move around and access to water. As such, it is important to consider whether you have the resources to provide a suitable environment for a capybara before attempting to keep one as a pet.

In conclusion, it is not legal to own a capybara as a pet in England without a licence from the local authority. Furthermore, even if you are able to obtain a licence, it is important to consider the welfare of the animal and whether you have the necessary resources to provide a suitable environment for the capybara.
