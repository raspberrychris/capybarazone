title: Is It Legal To Own A Capybara In West Virginia
---

It is not legal to own a capybara in West Virginia. According to the West Virginia Department of Natural Resources, capybaras are considered to be exotic animals and are not allowed to be kept as pets in the state. The only exceptions are for zoological parks, animal exhibitors, research facilities, and educational institutions. Furthermore, even if you were able to obtain a permit to keep a capybara as a pet, it is important to note that capybaras are highly social animals and require a lot of space, companionship, and attention. They are also very active animals and need plenty of room to roam and explore. For these reasons, it is not recommended to keep a capybara as a pet, even if it is legal in your state.
