The exact value of a super capybara is difficult to determine, as the market for these animals is relatively small. Generally speaking, however, a super capybara can be worth anywhere from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars, depending on the individual animal, its age, and its health. 

Super capybaras are a type of rodent native to South America, and they are the largest living rodent in the world. They can reach up to 4.5 feet in length and weigh up to 140 pounds. They are highly social animals, and they live in large groups in wetlands and grasslands.

Super capybaras are becoming increasingly popular as pets, and they can make great companions for people who have the time and space to properly care for them. They require a large enclosure, a pool of water, and plenty of space to roam. They are also relatively easy to care for, as they are herbivores and can be fed a variety of vegetables and fruits.

When it comes to determining the value of a super capybara, there are several factors to consider. The age of the animal is important, as younger animals tend to be more expensive than older ones. Additionally, the health of the animal is important, as animals with health issues may be worth less than healthier ones. Finally, the individual animal's temperament is also important, as animals that are more docile and easy to handle may be worth more than those that are more aggressive or difficult to handle.

Overall, the exact value of a super capybara can vary greatly, and it is difficult to determine an exact price. However, generally speaking, these animals can be worth anywhere from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars, depending on the individual animal, its age, and its health.
