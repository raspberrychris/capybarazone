A capybara is the largest rodent in the world and can weigh anywhere from 35 to 66 kilograms (77 to 145 pounds). The average capybara is about 50 to 60 centimeters (20 to 24 inches) tall at the shoulder and can reach up to 1.2 meters (4 feet) in length. They have a barrel-shaped body with short legs and a large head. Their fur is usually a reddish-brown color and they have webbed feet and a long, scaly tail.

Capybaras are found in South America, primarily in the tropical rainforests, wetlands, and grasslands. They are semi-aquatic animals and spend much of their time in or near water. They are also very social animals and can live in groups of up to 100 individuals.

Capybaras are herbivores and their diet consists mostly of grasses, aquatic plants, fruits, and vegetables. They are also known to eat their own feces, which is thought to help them digest their food more efficiently.

Capybaras are very strong swimmers and can stay submerged underwater for up to five minutes at a time. They are also excellent climbers and can use their sharp claws to climb trees and other structures.

Capybaras are very important to their ecosystems as they help to disperse seeds and control aquatic plant growth. They are also important prey for predators such as jaguars, ocelots, and caimans.
