A capybara is a large rodent native to South America that is becoming increasingly popular as a pet. They are the largest rodent in the world, and can grow up to 2 feet tall and weigh up to 140 pounds. The cost of a capybara can vary greatly depending on where you purchase it, the age of the animal, and the type of care it will need. 

On average, a capybara can cost anywhere from $400 to $2,000. This price range can vary depending on the age of the animal, its health, and the type of care it will need. Younger capybaras tend to be more expensive, as they require more care and attention. 

In addition to the cost of the animal itself, there are other costs associated with owning a capybara. These include housing, food, bedding, and veterinary care. A suitable enclosure for a capybara should be large enough to accommodate them and provide enough space for them to move around. It should also be secure and escape-proof. The cost of housing a capybara can range from $100 to $500, depending on the size and type of enclosure. 

Food and bedding for a capybara can cost anywhere from $50 to $200 per month, depending on the type of food and bedding you choose. Veterinary care is also important for capybaras, and can range from $50 to $200 per year, depending on the type of care needed. 

Overall, the cost of owning a capybara can range from $500 to $2,500, depending on the age of the animal, the type of care it needs, and the cost of housing, food, and veterinary care.
