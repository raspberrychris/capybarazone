title: What is the lifespan of a capybara?
---

The lifespan of a capybara can vary depending on the species and the environment in which it lives. Generally, capybaras have a lifespan of 4-8 years in the wild, and up to 10-12 years in captivity. In the wild, capybaras are susceptible to predators, as well as diseases and parasites, which can reduce their lifespan. In captivity, they are typically well cared for and have access to veterinary care, which can help them live longer.
