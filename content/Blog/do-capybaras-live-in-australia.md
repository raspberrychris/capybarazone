title: Do capybaras live in Australia?
---

No, capybaras do not live in Australia. Capybaras are native to South America and are found in countries such as Venezuela, Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina. They inhabit areas near rivers, swamps, and lakes and can also be found in flooded areas of the Amazon rainforest. They are semi-aquatic animals and are well adapted to living in and around water.
