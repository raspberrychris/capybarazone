Capybaras are herbivores, meaning they mainly eat vegetation such as grasses, aquatic plants, fruits, and vegetables. They are known to graze on various grasses, as well as aquatic plants found in and around bodies of water. They also feed on melons, squash, and other fruits and vegetables when available. In addition to vegetation, capybaras will also occasionally eat insects, snails, and small fish.
