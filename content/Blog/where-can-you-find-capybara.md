title: Where Can You Find Capybara
---

Capybaras are the largest living rodent species in the world and can be found in a variety of habitats throughout much of South America. They are semi-aquatic animals and are often found near bodies of water such as rivers, streams, ponds, and lakes. They are also known to inhabit marshes, swamps, and flooded areas. In addition to these wetland habitats, capybaras can also be found in grasslands, savannas, and even forests.

Capybaras are social animals and can often be found in groups of 10-20 individuals. They are most active during the early morning and late afternoon hours, and spend much of the day resting in the shade. They are herbivorous animals and their diet consists mainly of grasses, aquatic plants, and fruits.

Capybaras are not typically found in the wild in North America, but they can be found in some zoos and wildlife sanctuaries. Some states in the United States also allow the keeping of capybaras as pets, although it is important to check with local laws and regulations before doing so.
