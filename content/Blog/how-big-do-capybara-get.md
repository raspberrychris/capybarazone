They have a barrel-shaped body, short legs, and a large head with small ears and eyes. Their fur is usually a reddish-brown color, and they have a white or yellow muzzle.

Capybaras have a lifespan of 8-10 years in the wild, and up to 12 years in captivity. They are social animals and live in groups of up to 20 individuals. They are mainly found in South America, in areas near rivers, lakes, and marshes.

Capybaras are herbivores and feed mainly on grasses, aquatic plants, and fruits. They are also known to eat their own feces, which helps them to digest their food more efficiently.

Capybaras are excellent swimmers and can stay underwater for up to five minutes. They are also quite fast on land, and can reach speeds of up to 35 km/h (22 mph). They are also very good climbers, and can scale walls and fences with ease.

Capybaras are gentle and docile animals, and they make great pets. They are also very intelligent and can be trained to do a variety of tricks. They are also very friendly and social, and can get along well with other animals, including cats and dogs.
