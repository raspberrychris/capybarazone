The reason why I shot my capybara is a complex one and it likely involves a combination of factors. First and foremost, it is important to note that shooting a capybara is not something to be taken lightly and should only be done as a last resort. 

In my case, the primary reason why I shot my capybara was because it posed a threat to my safety and the safety of my family. The capybara had been living in my backyard for some time and had become increasingly aggressive towards myself and my family. It had started to lunge at us and even bite us on occasion. We had tried to scare it away, but it seemed to be getting more and more aggressive. We had also tried to capture it and relocate it, but it had proven to be too difficult. As such, shooting it seemed to be the only viable option left.

Another factor that may have influenced my decision to shoot the capybara was the fact that it was causing damage to my property. The capybara had started to dig up my garden and had caused considerable destruction to my backyard. It had also been eating my vegetables and fruits, which was causing financial losses for me. 

Finally, I may have also been influenced by the fact that I was concerned about the safety of my neighbors. The capybara had started to wander into their yards and had become a nuisance in the neighborhood. It seemed like shooting it was the only way to protect them from the potential danger it posed.

In conclusion, there were a number of factors that likely influenced my decision to shoot my capybara. Primarily, it was because it posed a threat to my safety and the safety of my family, it was causing damage to my property, and I was concerned about the safety of my neighbors.
