Capybaras are the worldâ€™s largest rodents and can live up to 8-10 years in the wild. In captivity, they can live up to 12-15 years. The average lifespan of a capybara is around 8-10 years, although some have been known to live longer than this. 

Capybaras are social animals and live in groups of around 10-20 individuals. They are also highly adaptable and can survive in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, swamps, and even near human settlements.

Capybaras have a few adaptations that help them to survive in the wild. They have webbed feet that help them to swim and move quickly through water. They also have sharp claws and teeth that help them to dig burrows and find food.

In order to stay healthy, capybaras need a diet that is high in fiber and low in fat. They feed on grasses, aquatic plants, fruits, and vegetables. They also eat small insects and fish.

Capybaras have a few predators in the wild, including jaguars, ocelots, caimans, and anacondas. They are also threatened by human activities such as hunting and habitat destruction.

In order to ensure that capybaras live long and healthy lives, it is important to provide them with a safe and secure habitat. This includes plenty of space, access to water, and a diet that is high in fiber and low in fat. It is also important to monitor their health and provide them with veterinary care when needed.
