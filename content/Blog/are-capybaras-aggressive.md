title: Are capybaras aggressive?
---

No, capybaras are not generally considered to be aggressive animals. In fact, they are often described as docile and gentle creatures. They are social animals that live in groups and can be quite friendly towards humans. They can become aggressive if they feel threatened or if they are provoked, but this is not their natural state. For the most part, capybaras are peaceful animals that prefer to spend their time grazing, swimming, and playing with their family and friends.
