A capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) is a large rodent native to South America. It is the largest living rodent in the world, and is closely related to guinea pigs, chinchillas, and agoutis. Capybaras are semi-aquatic, and can be found near bodies of water such as rivers, streams, and ponds. They are also excellent swimmers, and can even hold their breath underwater for up to five minutes.

Capybaras are herbivores, and their diet consists of grasses, aquatic plants, fruits, and vegetables. They are social animals, and live in large groups of up to 100 individuals. They are also very vocal, and communicate with a variety of sounds, including barks, whistles, and clicks.

Capybaras are closely related to other members of the Caviidae family, which includes guinea pigs, chinchillas, and agoutis. They are also related to other rodents, such as porcupines, beavers, and nutrias. All of these animals share certain characteristics, such as their large size, herbivorous diet, and social behavior.
