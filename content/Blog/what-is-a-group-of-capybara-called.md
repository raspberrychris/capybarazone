title: What Is A Group Of Capybara Called
---

A group of capybara is called a "herd". Capybara are social animals and live in groups of up to 20 individuals. They are very social and can often be seen grooming each other and playing in the water. The dominant male is usually the leader of the herd and will protect the group from predators. The herd also consists of a few adult females, their young, and several sub-adults. The herd will stay together for protection and to provide food for the young. The capybara will also use their loud vocalizations to alert the herd of danger. The herd will also migrate to new areas depending on the availability of food and water.
