title: Where To Find Capybara
---

Capybara can be found in a variety of habitats, including tropical rainforests, grasslands, swamps, and rivers. They are native to South America, but they have been introduced to other parts of the world, including the United States.

Capybaras are semi-aquatic animals and they are most commonly found near bodies of water such as rivers, streams, and ponds. They are also often found in wetland areas, such as marshes and swamps. They are also known to inhabit grasslands and savannas.

Capybaras are social animals and they live in groups of up to 20 individuals. They are usually seen in pairs or small family groups. The groups are led by a dominant male.

Capybaras are herbivores and they feed on grasses, aquatic plants, fruits, and vegetables. They are also known to eat insects, snails, and small fish.

Capybaras are active during the day and they spend much of their time in the water. They are excellent swimmers and they are able to stay submerged for up to five minutes. They are also excellent climbers and they can climb trees and other structures.

Capybaras are generally shy animals and they are not usually seen in the wild unless they are disturbed. However, they can be seen in zoos and wildlife parks.
