title: Do capybaras bite?
---

No, capybaras do not bite. Capybaras are large rodents that are native to South America and are the largest living rodent in the world. They are herbivores and are generally gentle and docile animals. They are social animals and enjoy the company of other capybaras and humans. They communicate with each other through vocalizations and body language. They do not have any natural predators, so they do not need to use their teeth to defend themselves.
