title: Where Are Capybara Located
---

Capybaras are found throughout much of South America, including parts of Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina. They inhabit a variety of habitats, such as grasslands, swamps, marshes, and forests, and can be found near rivers, streams, and ponds. They are well adapted to life in and around water, and can even swim and dive. They are also found in agricultural areas, as they are known to feed on crops such as sugar cane, melons, and squash.

Capybaras are social animals, living in groups of up to 20 individuals. They are diurnal, meaning they are active during the day, and they spend their time grazing, resting, and playing in the water. They are also known to form close bonds with one another, and have been observed grooming and cuddling with each other.

Capybaras are herbivores, and their diet consists mostly of grasses, aquatic plants, and fruit. They are also known to eat their own feces, which helps them to extract more nutrients from their food.

Capybaras are considered a pest species in some areas, as they can cause damage to crops and other vegetation. They are also hunted for their meat and fur, and are considered an invasive species in some areas. As a result, their numbers have declined in some areas, and they are listed as vulnerable in some parts of their range. Conservation efforts are underway in many areas to help protect capybaras and their habitats.
