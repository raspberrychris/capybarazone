---

Animals like capybara for a variety of reasons. First, capybara are incredibly social animals, forming strong bonds with their family groups and even with humans. This makes them great companions for other animals, as they are very affectionate and loyal. 

Second, capybara are herbivores, meaning their diet is mostly composed of plants and grasses. This makes them a great source of food for other animals, as they are relatively easy to find and catch. 

Third, capybara are excellent swimmers, and their webbed feet make them well-adapted for life in the water. This makes them a great source of entertainment for other animals, as they can be seen playing and swimming in the water. 

Finally, capybara are relatively docile and non-aggressive, making them a safe and enjoyable animal to be around. This makes them an ideal pet for other animals, as they are unlikely to attack or cause any harm. 

All of these factors make capybara a great animal for other animals to interact with, and it is no surprise that they are so popular.
