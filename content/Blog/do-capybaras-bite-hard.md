title: Do capybaras bite hard?
---

No, capybaras do not bite hard. They have large, flat teeth that are designed for grinding vegetation, not for biting or tearing flesh. They also have very weak jaw muscles, so even if they were to bite someone, the bite would not be very strong. In general, capybaras are not known to be aggressive and their bite is not considered dangerous.
