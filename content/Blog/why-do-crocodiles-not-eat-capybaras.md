title: Why do crocodiles not eat capybaras?
---

Crocodiles do not typically eat capybaras because they are not a natural part of their diet. Capybaras are much larger than most of the prey that crocodiles typically hunt, and they are also very fast and agile on land. This makes them difficult for crocodiles to catch and they are not worth the effort. Additionally, capybaras are semi-aquatic animals, meaning they spend a lot of time in the water, which is not an ideal environment for crocodiles to hunt in. Furthermore, capybaras are herbivores, meaning they do not provide the same amount of nutrition that carnivorous animals do. Therefore, it is not worth the effort for crocodiles to hunt capybaras.
