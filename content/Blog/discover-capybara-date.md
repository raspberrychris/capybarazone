The capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) is a large, semi-aquatic rodent native to South America. It is the largest living rodent in the world, and is closely related to guinea pigs and rock cavies. It is believed that the capybara was first discovered by Europeans in the early 1500s, when Spanish explorers encountered them in the wild in what is now Venezuela. However, it is likely that the native people of South America had known about the capybara for centuries before that.

The capybara is an important species in its native range, where it is hunted for its meat and fur. It is also kept as a pet in some parts of the world, and is often seen in zoos and wildlife parks. The species is considered to be of least concern by the IUCN, although its population is decreasing due to hunting and habitat loss.

The capybara is an interesting and unique animal, and its discovery by Europeans in the 1500s has helped to bring it into the public consciousness. It is an important species in its native range, and its popularity as a pet has helped to ensure its continued survival.
