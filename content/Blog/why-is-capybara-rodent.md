Capybaras are well adapted to their semi-aquatic lifestyle. They have the ability to stay submerged underwater for up to 5 minutes, and can swim at speeds of up to 8 miles per hour. They also have a layer of fat around their neck and shoulders that helps them stay warm in cold water.

Overall, capybaras are classified as rodents because of their physical characteristics, diet, and behavior. They are the largest living rodent in the world, and are well adapted to their semi-aquatic lifestyle.
