title: How Long Does Capybara Live
---

The average lifespan of a capybara is around 4 to 8 years in the wild, though they can live up to 10 years in captivity. In the wild, capybaras are subject to predation from jaguars, ocelots, caimans, and anacondas, as well as humans. Disease, starvation, and dehydration can also reduce their lifespan.

In captivity, capybaras are generally well cared for and can live up to 10 years with proper nutrition and veterinary care. They are social animals and need companionship, so it is important to provide them with a suitable living environment and plenty of enrichment activities to keep them stimulated.

Capybaras are considered to be a low-maintenance pet, but require regular veterinary check-ups and a healthy diet. They should be fed a diet of hay, vegetables, and fruits, as well as a high-quality pellet feed. They also need access to fresh water and a place to bathe and swim.

Overall, capybaras can live up to 10 years in captivity with proper care and nutrition. In the wild, however, their lifespan is much shorter due to predation and other factors.
