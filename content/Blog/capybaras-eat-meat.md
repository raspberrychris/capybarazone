title: Do capybaras eat meat?
---

No, capybaras are herbivores, meaning they only eat plants. They feed mainly on grasses, aquatic plants, fruits, and tree bark. They also eat their own feces, which helps them to digest their food more efficiently. Capybaras are semi-aquatic animals, so they spend a lot of their time in or near water, where they can easily access aquatic plants.
