title: How-Long-Can-Capybara-Hold-Breath
---

A capybara can hold its breath for up to five minutes. This is because the capybara is a semi-aquatic rodent and is well adapted to living in and around water. Its body is specially designed to help it stay submerged for extended periods of time. The capybara has a large lung capacity, allowing it to take in more oxygen and store it for longer periods of time. It also has a high concentration of hemoglobin, which helps it absorb and retain oxygen. Additionally, the capybara has a specialized circulatory system that helps it conserve oxygen and release carbon dioxide more efficiently. All of these adaptations help the capybara stay submerged for longer periods of time and hold its breath for up to five minutes.
