title: What Does The Capybara Eat
---

The capybara is a large, semi-aquatic rodent native to South America. It is the largest rodent in the world, growing up to 4 feet long and weighing up to 140 pounds. The capybara is a herbivore, meaning it eats mostly plants. Its diet consists mainly of grasses, aquatic plants, fruit, and tree bark. It also eats its own feces, which helps it to digest its plant-based diet. The capybara also eats small fish, snails, and crabs, which it finds in the water. In captivity, capybaras are often fed hay, vegetables, and specially formulated pellets. They also enjoy treats such as melon, squash, and sweet potatoes.
