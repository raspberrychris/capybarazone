title: How To Tame Capybara Minecraft Minecraft Tutorial
---

Taming a Capybara in Minecraft can be a tricky task, but it is possible. The first step to taming a Capybara is to find one. Capybaras spawn in the Savannah and Savanna Plateau biomes. Once you have found a Capybara, you will need to feed it. You can do this by giving it any type of vegetable. Carrots, potatoes, and wheat are all good options. Once the Capybara has eaten the food, it will become tame.

Once the Capybara is tamed, you can ride it. To ride the Capybara, you will need to equip a saddle. You can craft a saddle with three leather and two iron ingots. Once you have the saddle equipped, you can right-click on the Capybara to mount it.

You can also breed Capybaras to create more tame ones. To do this, you will need to feed two tamed Capybaras any type of vegetable. After a few moments, they will produce a baby Capybara. The baby Capybara will be tamed and you can ride it just like the other tamed Capybaras.

Taming a Capybara in Minecraft can be a fun and rewarding experience. With a bit of patience and the right resources, you can have your own tamed Capybara in no time.
