The best places to spot them are in the Everglades National Park, the Big Cypress National Preserve, and the Florida Panther National Wildlife Refuge.

Additionally, the Fakahatchee Strand Preserve State Park is another great place to see capybara, as they are often seen in the marshes and wetlands.

Additionally, it’s important to remember to never feed the capybara, as this can cause them to become dependent on humans for food and can lead to health problems.
