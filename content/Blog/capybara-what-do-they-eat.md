title: Capybara What Do They Eat
---

Capybaras are herbivores, meaning they primarily eat plants. Their diet consists of grasses, aquatic plants, fruits, and vegetables. They also eat their own soft feces, which helps them to digest their food more efficiently. In the wild, they can be seen grazing on grasses and aquatic plants in marshes, ponds, and lakes. They also eat fruits and vegetables, such as melons, squash, and sweet potatoes. In captivity, they are often fed hay, grass, and vegetables. They also enjoy treats such as apples, bananas, and other fruits. 

Capybaras have an interesting digestive system that allows them to digest tough, fibrous plant matter. They have a special set of teeth that are designed to grind up tough plant material. They also have a large, complex stomach that helps them to break down the food they eat. 

Capybaras are social animals and enjoy spending time with other capybaras. They will often share food, and they are known to eat out of each other's mouths. This behavior helps them bond and form strong social relationships. 

Capybaras are also known to eat insects and small fish. They may also occasionally eat the eggs of aquatic birds. 

Overall, capybaras have a varied diet that consists of grasses, aquatic plants, fruits, vegetables, and occasionally insects and small fish. They have special teeth and a large, complex stomach that helps them to digest tough plant matter. They also enjoy sharing food and forming social relationships.
