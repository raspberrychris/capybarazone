A capybara is a large, semi-aquatic rodent native to South America. It is the largest living rodent in the world, weighing up to 140 pounds and measuring up to 4 feet in length. Capybaras are excellent swimmers and can remain submerged underwater for up to five minutes. They are also excellent climbers and can be found in a variety of habitats, from grasslands to wetlands. 

Capybaras are social animals and live in groups of up to 20 individuals. They are herbivores and feed on grasses, aquatic plants, fruits, and tree bark. They are also known to eat their own feces, which helps them to digest their food more efficiently.

Capybaras have thick, reddish-brown fur and webbed toes that help them to swim. They have short, rounded ears and a short, stubby tail. They have large, sharp incisors that are used for cutting and grinding vegetation.

Capybaras are an important species in their native ecosystems, as they help to control vegetation growth and disperse seeds. They are also hunted for their meat and fur, and their populations are threatened by habitat destruction and illegal hunting.
