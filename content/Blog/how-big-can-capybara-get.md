A capybara can grow to be quite large. The average capybara can reach lengths of up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) and weigh up to 140 pounds (64 kilograms). The largest capybara ever recorded was approximately 5 feet (1.5 meters) long and weighed around 200 pounds (90 kilograms).

Capybaras are the largest living rodent in the world and are native to South America. They are semi-aquatic animals and can be found living in dense vegetation near bodies of water such as rivers, streams, and lakes. They are herbivores, and their diet consists mainly of grasses, aquatic plants, and fruits.

Capybaras are social animals and live in groups of up to 20 individuals. They communicate with each other through a variety of vocalizations such as whistles, barks, and squeaks. They are also excellent swimmers and can stay underwater for up to five minutes.

Capybaras are very popular in the pet trade, but due to their size and dietary requirements, they require a lot of space and special care. They are also considered an invasive species in some parts of the world and can cause damage to local ecosystems if not managed properly.
