Capybaras are semi-aquatic rodents native to South America, primarily found in and around bodies of water. They inhabit a variety of different habitats, including marshes, swamps, rivers, lakes, and flooded grasslands. Capybaras are the largest rodents in the world, and can weigh up to 140 pounds.

Capybaras are social animals and live in groups of 10-20 individuals, with one dominant male. They are herbivores and feed on grasses, aquatic plants, and fruits. They are active during the day and sleep in the water at night, with their nose and eyes just above the surface.

Capybaras have several adaptations that help them survive in their aquatic environment. They have webbed feet and a thick, waterproof coat that helps them swim. They also have sharp claws that help them dig burrows and escape predators.

Capybaras are found in many countries in South America, including Brazil, Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina. They are also found in Central America, in Panama, Costa Rica, and Nicaragua.
