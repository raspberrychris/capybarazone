---

A capybara is a large, semi-aquatic rodent native to South America. It is the largest rodent in the world, weighing up to 140 pounds and measuring up to four feet in length. 

Capybaras are herbivores, meaning they eat only plant matter. Their diet consists mainly of grasses, aquatic plants, fruits, and tree bark. They also eat their own feces, which helps them break down plant matter more efficiently and extract more nutrients. 

In the wild, capybaras spend most of their day grazing on grasses and aquatic plants. They also eat fruits, such as melons, and tree bark. They may also eat insects, snails, and small fish. 

In captivity, capybaras are usually fed a diet of hay, fruits, vegetables, and commercial capybara pellets. They may also be given treats, such as boiled eggs or cooked sweet potatoes. 

Overall, capybaras are omnivorous animals and their diet consists of a variety of plant and animal matter. They eat grasses, aquatic plants, fruits, tree bark, insects, snails, small fish, and their own feces. In captivity, they are usually fed hay, fruits, vegetables, and commercial capybara pellets.
