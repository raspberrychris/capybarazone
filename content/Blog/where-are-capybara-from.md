title: Where-Are-Capybara-From

Capybara are native to South America and are found in the tropical rainforests, savannas, and wetlands of Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and Argentina. They are the largest living rodent in the world and can weigh up to 140 pounds.

Capybara are semi-aquatic animals and are well adapted to life in and around water. They are excellent swimmers and can remain submerged for up to five minutes. They have webbed feet and a water-repellent coat that helps them stay afloat. They are also able to sleep underwater with just their noses above the surface.

Capybara are herbivores and feed mainly on grasses, aquatic plants, fruits, and tree bark. They live in large groups, often numbering up to 100 individuals, and are very social animals. They communicate through a variety of vocalizations, including whistles, barks, and grunts.

Capybara are hunted for their meat and fur in some parts of their range, and their habitats are being destroyed by deforestation and other human activities. As a result, their populations are declining in some areas and they are considered vulnerable to extinction.
