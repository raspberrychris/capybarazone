title: Can capybaras bark?
---

No, capybaras cannot bark. Capybaras are large rodents that are native to South America and are the largest rodents in the world. They have a wide variety of vocalizations, including grunts, barks, and whistles, but these are not the same as a bark that is commonly associated with dogs. Capybaras are also known to communicate through body language, such as posturing, tail movements, and facial expressions.
