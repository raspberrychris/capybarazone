Capybaras are excellent swimmers and can swim at speeds of up to 5 miles per hour (8 km/h). They are well adapted to aquatic environments and can stay underwater for up to five minutes at a time. They use their webbed feet to propel themselves through the water and their large, flat tails to steer. They can also use their front legs to paddle and their back legs to push off the bottom of the water.

In addition to being able to swim quickly, capybaras are also strong swimmers. They can easily navigate rivers and streams and can even swim across large bodies of water. They are also able to dive and can stay underwater for long periods of time in order to avoid predators.

Capybaras are also able to use their swimming skills to escape from danger. They can swim away from predators quickly and can even use their swimming skills to evade capture.

Overall, capybaras are very capable swimmers and can swim at speeds of up to 5 miles per hour (8 km/h). They are also strong swimmers and can easily navigate rivers and streams. They are also able to use their swimming skills to escape from danger and evade capture.
