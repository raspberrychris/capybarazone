Drawing a capybara can be easy with the right steps. Here are some tips to help you draw a capybara:

1. Start by sketching the basic shape of the capybara. Use a pencil to lightly draw a circle for the head, a large oval for the body, and two smaller ovals for the legs.

2. Add details to the face. Draw two eyes, a nose, and a mouth.

3. Draw the ears. Capybaras have large ears that are shaped like triangles.

4. Add the fur. Use short, curved lines to draw the fur on the body, legs, and head.

5. Add the tail. Draw a curved line for the tail.

6. Outline the drawing. Use a pen or marker to go over the pencil lines and make the drawing more defined.

7. Color the drawing. Use a variety of colors to give the capybara a realistic look.

Following these steps should make it easy to draw a capybara. With a little practice, you should be able to draw a realistic looking capybara in no time.
