title: How fast is a capybara in mph?
---

A capybara is a large rodent native to South America, and is the largest rodent in the world. The average capybara can reach speeds of up to 10 mph (16 km/h) when running, though they can reach speeds of up to 24 mph (39 km/h) in short bursts. However, capybaras are not built for sustained speed and usually prefer to move at a slower pace, typically around 5 mph (8 km/h).
