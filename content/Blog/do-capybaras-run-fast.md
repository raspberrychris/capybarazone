title: Do capybaras run fast?
---

No, capybaras do not run fast. Capybaras are semi-aquatic rodents native to South America and are the largest living rodent in the world. They are slow-moving animals, and their top speed is only around 4-5 miles per hour. This is much slower than other animals such as horses, which can reach speeds of up to 40 miles per hour. Capybaras are also not very agile, so they cannot make sharp turns or sudden movements quickly. They prefer to stay in the water, where they can swim quickly to escape predators.
