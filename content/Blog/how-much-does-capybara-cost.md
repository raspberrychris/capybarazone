title: How much does capybara cost?
---

The cost of a capybara can vary widely depending on where you purchase it from and the age of the animal. Generally, pet capybaras can cost anywhere from $500 to $2,500, depending on the breeder and the age of the animal. If you are looking for a show-quality capybara, the cost can be significantly higher. Additionally, you will need to factor in the cost of housing, food, and veterinary care for your capybara.
