title: How Big Does Capybara Get
---

The capybara is the largest living rodent in the world, and can grow to be quite large. On average, capybaras reach lengths of around 4 feet (1.2 meters) and weigh between 66 and 154 pounds (30-70 kg). They have a stout body, short head, and small ears and eyes. Their fur is thick and coarse, and can range from reddish-brown to yellowish-brown in color.

Capybaras are well-adapted to living in and around water, and can be found in a variety of habitats including marshes, swamps, rivers, lakes, and ponds. They spend most of their time in or near water, and can even stay submerged for up to five minutes.

As social animals, capybaras live in groups of up to 20 individuals. They communicate with each other through a variety of vocalizations, including barks, whistles, and grunts. They are also quite vocal when threatened, and will bark loudly to alert the rest of the group.

Capybaras are herbivores, and their diet consists mainly of grasses, aquatic plants, and fruits. They are also known to eat their own droppings, which helps them to obtain essential nutrients from their food.

In the wild, capybaras can live up to 8-10 years, while in captivity they can live up to 12-15 years.
