No, it is not legal to keep a capybara as a pet in the United Kingdom. Capybaras are classified as exotic animals, and it is illegal to keep them as pets in the UK. The UK government has strict regulations in place regarding the keeping of exotic animals, and it is illegal to keep any exotic animal without a licence. This means that it is not possible to keep a capybara as a pet in the UK.
