title: What Eats Capybara
---

Capybaras are large rodents native to South America and are the largest living rodent in the world. They are herbivores, which means they mainly eat grasses, aquatic plants, fruits, and tree bark. They also eat their own feces, which helps them to digest their food more efficiently. 

Capybaras are preyed upon by a variety of animals, including jaguars, ocelots, caimans, anacondas, and harpy eagles. Other predators include foxes, wild dogs, and humans. In some areas, caimans are the primary predators of capybaras. Caimans are large reptiles that live in and around bodies of water. They hunt capybaras by stalking them near the water’s edge and then quickly attacking them. 

Harpy eagles are large birds of prey that live in South America. They hunt capybaras by swooping down and grabbing them with their talons. They can also snatch capybaras from the water’s surface. 

Jaguars are the largest cats in the Americas and are capable of taking down large prey, including capybaras. They hunt by stalking their prey and then pouncing on them. Ocelots are smaller cats that hunt capybaras by stalking them and then ambushing them. 

Humans have also been known to hunt capybaras for their meat, fur, and hide. This has led to a decline in their population in some areas.
