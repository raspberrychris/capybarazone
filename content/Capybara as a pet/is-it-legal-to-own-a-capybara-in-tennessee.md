---

In Tennessee, it is not legal to own a capybara as a pet. Capybaras are classified as exotic animals, and Tennessee has strict laws regarding the ownership of exotic animals. According to Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 70-4-401, it is illegal to own, possess, or have custody of any wild animal, including capybaras, unless the person has obtained a permit from the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency (TWRA). Additionally, the TWRA has the authority to issue permits for the possession of exotic animals only for educational, scientific, or exhibition purposes. Therefore, it is not possible to obtain a permit to own a capybara as a pet in Tennessee.
