title: Is It Legal To Own A Capybara In Australia
---

In Australia, it is not legal to own a capybara as a pet. Capybaras are native to South America and are classified as exotic animals, meaning they are not native to Australia and do not have a natural habitat in the country. As such, they are not allowed to be kept as pets.

In addition, capybaras require a specific diet and environment to stay healthy and happy, and it is not possible to replicate this in a domestic setting. They are also social animals, which means they need to be kept with other capybaras in order to be properly cared for. Furthermore, they require a large amount of space and can be destructive if not given enough room to roam.

In Australia, there are strict regulations in place to protect native wildlife and exotic animals, and it is illegal to keep any exotic animal as a pet. Therefore, it is not legal to own a capybara in Australia.
