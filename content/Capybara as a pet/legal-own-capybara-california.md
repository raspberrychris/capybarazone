---

In California, it is not legal to own a capybara as a pet. Capybaras are classified as exotic animals, and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) prohibits the possession of exotic animals as pets. This includes capybaras, which are native to South America and are the largest rodents in the world. 

In California, it is illegal to possess, sell, offer for sale, import, export, or propagate any live animal of any prohibited species without a permit. This includes capybaras, which are considered exotic animals and are not allowed to be kept as pets. It is also illegal to release any non-native species into the wild, as this could have a negative impact on the local environment. 

In addition, it is illegal to keep any wild animal as a pet in California. This includes capybaras, which are considered wild animals and are not suitable for captivity. Capybaras require a large amount of space and specialized care, and they are not domesticated animals. 

If you are found to be in possession of a capybara without a permit, you could be subject to fines and other penalties, including jail time. For these reasons, it is not legal to own a capybara in California.
