title: Is It Legal To Own A Capybara In Maryland
---

In Maryland, it is not legal to own a capybara as a pet. Capybaras are classified as exotic animals, and the state has strict laws and regulations governing the ownership of exotic animals. According to the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, it is illegal to possess any wild animal, including capybaras, without a permit from the state. In addition, the state requires that any animal kept as a pet must be kept in a humane and safe environment. As capybaras are large, semi-aquatic rodents, they require specialized care that many people are not able to provide. For these reasons, it is not legal to own a capybara in Maryland.
