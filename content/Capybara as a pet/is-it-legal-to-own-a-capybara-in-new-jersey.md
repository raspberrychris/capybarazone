title: Is It Legal To Own A Capybara In New Jersey
---

It is not legal to own a capybara in New Jersey. According to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, capybaras are considered an exotic pet and are not allowed to be kept as pets in the state. This is because capybaras are native to South America and are not native to New Jersey, so introducing them into the state could have a negative impact on the environment. Additionally, capybaras can be difficult to care for and require a large enclosure and specialized diet, and they can be quite expensive to purchase. Furthermore, capybaras can be dangerous if they are not handled properly, as they have large teeth and can bite. For these reasons, it is not legal to own a capybara in New Jersey.
