title: Is It Legal To Own A Capybara In Minnesota
---

In Minnesota, it is not legal to own a capybara. Capybaras are considered an exotic pet, and exotic pets are not allowed in Minnesota. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has a list of animals that are not allowed to be kept as pets in the state, and capybaras are on that list. Additionally, the Minnesota Department of Agriculture has regulations for keeping exotic animals, and capybaras are not allowed to be kept as pets under those regulations. 

Capybaras are also not allowed to be kept as pets in many other states, including California, New York, and Texas. The best way to find out if it is legal to own a capybara in your state is to contact your local Department of Natural Resources or Department of Agriculture. 

Capybaras are also not an easy pet to care for. They require a large enclosure and a lot of space to roam. They also need a large pool of water to swim in and a diet of fresh fruits and vegetables. They can also be very expensive to purchase and maintain. 

For these reasons, it is not legal to own a capybara in Minnesota.
