title: Is It Legal To Own A Capybara In Turkey
---

No, it is not legal to own a capybara in Turkey. Capybaras are classified as wild animals and are protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). This means that it is illegal to own, trade, or transport a capybara in Turkey without a special permit. Additionally, the Turkish government has strict regulations regarding the keeping of wild animals as pets, and capybaras are not included in the list of animals that are allowed to be kept as pets. Therefore, owning a capybara in Turkey is not legal.
