title: Is It Legal To Own A Capybara In Israel
---

In Israel, it is not legal to own a capybara. The capybara is a large rodent native to South America, and it is not native to Israel. As such, it is not allowed to be kept as a pet in the country. Additionally, there are no laws or regulations that allow for the importation or keeping of exotic animals such as the capybara, so it is not possible to legally own one in Israel. Furthermore, the capybara is a wild animal and is not suited to living in captivity, so it is not recommended to try and keep one as a pet in any case.
