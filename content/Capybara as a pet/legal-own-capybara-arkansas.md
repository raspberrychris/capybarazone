title: Is It Legal To Own A Capybara In Arkansas
---

It is not legal to own a capybara in Arkansas. The Arkansas Game and Fish Commission does not allow the possession of any exotic animals, including capybaras. This is because exotic animals can pose a significant risk to public safety and to the health of native wildlife. Capybaras are large rodents that can grow up to four feet in length and weigh up to 140 pounds. They are also semi-aquatic animals and require a large body of water to survive. Furthermore, they are known to be carriers of diseases, such as rabies, which can be passed on to humans and other animals. Therefore, it is not legal to own a capybara in Arkansas.
