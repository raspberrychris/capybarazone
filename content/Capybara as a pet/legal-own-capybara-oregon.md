title: Is It Legal To Own A Capybara In Oregon
---

In Oregon, it is not legal to own a capybara as a pet. Capybaras are classified as exotic animals, and Oregon has strict laws regarding the ownership of exotic animals. According to Oregon Administrative Rule 603-048-0020, it is illegal to possess, import, export, buy, sell, barter, or offer for sale any live wild animal, including capybaras, in the state of Oregon. This rule applies to all wild animals, including those that are native to Oregon and those that are not. Additionally, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife does not issue permits for the possession of capybaras. 

In some cases, it may be possible to obtain a permit to possess a capybara in Oregon, but these permits are only issued in very limited circumstances. For example, if the capybara is being kept for educational or scientific purposes, or if it is being kept for exhibition or display in a zoo, then a permit may be issued. However, these permits are difficult to obtain and are only granted on a case-by-case basis.

In conclusion, it is not legal to own a capybara as a pet in Oregon. If you are interested in owning a capybara, you should contact the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife to determine if a permit is available in your situation.
