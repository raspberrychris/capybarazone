title: Is It Legal To Own A Capybara In Colorado
---

It is not legal to own a capybara in Colorado. Capybaras are classified as exotic animals, and the Colorado Department of Agriculture has strict regulations on the ownership of exotic animals. Capybaras require special housing and care, and the Colorado Department of Agriculture does not allow individuals to own exotic animals as pets. In addition, capybaras are known to be destructive and can cause damage to property, which is another reason why the Colorado Department of Agriculture does not allow them to be owned as pets. It is important to note that it is illegal to purchase, sell, or transport a capybara in Colorado, and any attempt to do so could result in criminal charges.
