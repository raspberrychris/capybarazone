title: Is It Legal To Own A Capybara In Florida
---

In Florida, it is not legal to own a capybara as a pet. Capybaras are classified as exotic animals, and the state of Florida has very strict regulations regarding the ownership of exotic animals. According to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, it is illegal to possess, sell, or import any species of wild animal that is not native to the state. This includes capybaras, which are native to South America and not found in the wild in Florida.

Additionally, even if you were to obtain a capybara from another state, it is illegal to bring it into Florida without a permit. Obtaining a permit for an exotic animal is very difficult, and the process can be lengthy and expensive. The permit also requires that the animal be kept in a secure enclosure that meets certain standards set by the state.

For these reasons, it is not legal to own a capybara in Florida. If you are interested in owning an exotic pet, it is best to research the laws in your state and find an animal that is allowed.
