It is not legal to own a capybara in South Carolina. According to the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, it is illegal to own any exotic animal as a pet in the state, including capybaras. This includes any animal that is not native to the state, such as the capybara, which is native to South America. Additionally, the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources states that it is illegal to transport any exotic animal into the state without a permit. This applies to both live animals and any parts of the animal, such as fur, meat, or eggs. It is also illegal to release any exotic animal into the wild in South Carolina. 

Violation of these laws can result in fines and even jail time. It is important to note that even if you are able to obtain a permit to own a capybara, it is still illegal to release the animal into the wild.
