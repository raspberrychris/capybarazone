title: Is It Legal To Own A Capybara In Wisconsin
---

No, it is not legal to own a capybara in Wisconsin. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) classifies capybaras as exotic animals, which are prohibited from being kept as pets in the state. Capybaras are native to South America and are considered to be an invasive species in the United States. As such, they are not allowed to be imported, possessed, sold, or released in Wisconsin. Furthermore, the DNR has strict regulations regarding the ownership of exotic animals, and capybaras are not listed as one of the species that can be kept as pets. 

Capybaras are large, semi-aquatic rodents that can weigh up to 140 pounds and grow to be over 4 feet long. They are social animals and require a lot of space and specialized care. They need to be kept in an enclosure that is large enough for them to move around and swim, and they need access to a pool of clean, fresh water. They also require a varied diet of grasses, fruits, and vegetables, as well as a regular supply of hay. 

Due to the size and specialized care requirements of capybaras, it is not recommended that they be kept as pets. In addition, the DNR does not allow them to be kept as pets in Wisconsin, so it is not legal to own one.
