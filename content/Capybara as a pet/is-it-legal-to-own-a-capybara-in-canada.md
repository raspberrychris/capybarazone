title: Is It Legal To Own A Capybara In Canada
---

In Canada, it is not legal to own a capybara as a pet. Capybaras are classified as exotic animals, and as such, are not allowed to be kept as pets in Canada. This is due to the fact that capybaras require specialized care and a large enclosure, and it is difficult to provide these things in a home environment. Additionally, capybaras are wild animals and can be dangerous if not handled properly. 

The laws regarding exotic animal ownership vary from province to province. In some provinces, such as Ontario and British Columbia, it is illegal to keep any exotic animal as a pet. In other provinces, such as Alberta and Quebec, it is possible to obtain a permit to keep certain exotic animals, but the permit must be renewed annually and the owner must meet certain requirements. 

In addition to the legal restrictions, it is important to consider the ethical implications of keeping a capybara as a pet. Capybaras are social animals and should not be kept alone. They also require a large enclosure and a diet that is difficult to replicate in a home environment. For these reasons, it is generally not recommended to keep capybaras as pets. 

Overall, it is not legal to own a capybara as a pet in Canada. Even if it is possible to obtain a permit in some provinces, it is important to consider the ethical implications of keeping an exotic animal as a pet before making the decision to do so.
