title: Is It Legal To Own A Capybara In Mississippi
---

No, it is not legal to own a capybara in Mississippi. According to Mississippi's exotic animal laws, it is illegal to own, transport, or sell any exotic animal, including capybaras, within the state. This is because exotic animals are not native to the state, and their introduction into the environment could have a negative impact on the local ecosystem. In addition, exotic animals can be dangerous to humans and other animals, and their ownership requires special licenses and permits that are not available in Mississippi. For these reasons, it is not legal to own a capybara in Mississippi.
