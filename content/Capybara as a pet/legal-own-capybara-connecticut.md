title: Is It Legal To Own A Capybara In Connecticut
---

No, it is not legal to own a capybara in Connecticut. According to the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, it is illegal to possess any exotic animals, including capybaras, without a permit. This includes animals that are kept as pets, for exhibition, or for commercial purposes. The only exceptions are certain species of birds, reptiles, and amphibians that are allowed to be kept as pets without a permit. 

The DEEP also has a list of prohibited animals, which includes capybaras. This means that even if you were able to obtain a permit, you would still not be allowed to keep a capybara as a pet. Additionally, the DEEP does not issue permits for the purpose of keeping exotic animals as pets. 

It is important to note that even if a capybara is allowed in another state, it is still illegal to bring the animal into Connecticut without a permit. This is because the DEEP has strict regulations on the importation of exotic animals, and any violation of these regulations could result in serious penalties. 

In conclusion, it is not legal to own a capybara in Connecticut. The DEEP does not issue permits for the purpose of keeping exotic animals as pets, and it is illegal to bring a capybara into the state without a permit.
