title: Is It Legal To Own A Capybara In Utah
---

In Utah, it is not legal to own a capybara. Capybaras are considered an exotic animal and are not allowed to be kept as pets in the state. The Utah Administrative Code states that it is illegal to possess any live wild animal, including capybaras, without a permit. The only exception is for those who have a USDA-licensed facility, which is very rare and difficult to obtain. In addition, the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food considers capybaras to be a nuisance animal and has strict regulations in place for their capture and relocation. For these reasons, it is not legal to own a capybara in Utah.
