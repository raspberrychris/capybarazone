title: Is It Legal To Own A Capybara In Puerto Rico
---

In Puerto Rico, it is not legal to own a capybara as a pet. Capybaras are considered an exotic species and are not allowed to be kept as pets in Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DRNA) strictly regulates the importation and possession of exotic species, including capybaras. The DRNA requires that all exotic species be obtained through a licensed wildlife dealer and that the species must be registered with the DRNA. In addition, the DRNA requires that all exotic species must be kept in an enclosure that meets their standards and that the enclosure must be inspected and approved by the DRNA. Furthermore, the DRNA requires that all exotic species must be kept in a secure environment that is not accessible to the public. 

In addition to the regulations set forth by the DRNA, it is important to note that capybaras require a great deal of care and attention. They are highly social animals and need to be kept in groups of at least three. They also require a large enclosure that is secure and provides plenty of space for them to roam and explore. They also need access to clean water and a diet that is high in fiber and low in fat. 

For these reasons, it is not recommended that capybaras be kept as pets in Puerto Rico. It is important to remember that capybaras are wild animals and should be treated with respect. If you are considering owning a capybara, it is best to consult with a qualified wildlife expert who can provide you with the necessary information and advice.
