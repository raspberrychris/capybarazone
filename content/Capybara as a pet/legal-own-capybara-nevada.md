In Nevada, it is not legal to own a capybara as a pet. Capybaras are classified as exotic animals, and the state of Nevada has strict regulations regarding the ownership of such animals. According to the Nevada Department of Wildlife, it is illegal to possess, import, export, breed, or sell any live wild animal, including capybaras, without a permit.
