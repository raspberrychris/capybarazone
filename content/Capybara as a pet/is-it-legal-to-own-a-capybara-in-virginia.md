title: Is It Legal To Own A Capybara In Virginia
---

In Virginia, it is illegal to own a capybara as a pet. The Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries (VDGIF) has declared the capybara an "invasive species" and states that "it is illegal to possess, import, sell, or transport any species of wildlife designated as an invasive species in Virginia, including the capybara." This is due to the fact that capybaras are not native to Virginia and can easily escape into the wild, where they can cause significant damage to the local ecosystem. 

Capybaras are also very large rodents, weighing up to 140 pounds, and can become aggressive and destructive when kept in captivity. They are also social animals that require a large amount of space and a complex environment to thrive. For these reasons, it is not recommended to keep a capybara as a pet in Virginia. 

If you are interested in owning a capybara, it is best to contact your local wildlife authorities to learn more about the laws and regulations in your area. Additionally, it is important to research the animal's needs and requirements to ensure that you can provide a safe and healthy environment for your pet.
