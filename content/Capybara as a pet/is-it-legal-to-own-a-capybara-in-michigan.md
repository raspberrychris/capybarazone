title: Is It Legal To Own A Capybara In Michigan
---

No, it is not legal to own a capybara in Michigan. Capybaras are classified as exotic animals, and Michigan has strict laws regarding the ownership of exotic animals. Michigan's Exotic Animal Law (Act 451 of 1994) states that it is illegal to possess any wild or exotic animal, including capybaras, unless the animal is held in accordance with a special permit issued by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. The law also states that it is illegal to possess any wild or exotic animal for any purpose other than scientific, educational, or exhibition purposes. Furthermore, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources has issued a list of prohibited species which includes capybaras, and it is illegal to possess any of the species listed. As such, it is not legal to own a capybara in Michigan.
